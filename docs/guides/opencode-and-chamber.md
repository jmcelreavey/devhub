# OpenCode and OpenChamber

DevHub runs four cooperating local services during `npm run dev` and `npm run start`:

| Service     | Default port | Dashboard route | Role                             |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Dashboard   | `1337`       | `/`             | Main Next.js app                 |
| OpenChamber | `1336`       | `/chamber`      | Thinking/workspace UI (iframe)   |
| OpenCode    | `1338`       | `/opencode`     | Coding assistant web UI (iframe) |
| Terminal    | `1339`       | Docked drawer   | In-app PTY shell (WebSocket peer) |

OpenCode is a **shared peer service**. OpenChamber connects to the same `opencode serve` instance instead of starting its own embedded server.

The **terminal peer** is a separate localhost-only WebSocket PTY (`dashboard/scripts/terminal-pty-server.ts`). The docked terminal (`TerminalDock`) connects over `ws://127.0.0.1:1339` and keeps sessions alive while hidden — long-running commands (including PR reviews) continue when you switch tabs.

OpenChamber is **developer-managed**: DevHub does not bundle it. Install it yourself (`npm i -g @openchamber/web`, or point `OPENCHAMBER_BIN` at any build) and DevHub serves it on `OPENCHAMBER_PORT` and embeds it. When no `openchamber` is found on `PATH` (and `OPENCHAMBER_BIN` is unset), the Chamber tab and its iframe are hidden and nothing is started.

## Startup Flow

```text
npm run dev
  -> start-peer-services.ts  -> opencode serve on OPENCODE_PORT (default 1338)
                             -> openchamber serve on OPENCHAMBER_PORT (default 1336)
                                with OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true
  -> terminal-pty-server.ts  -> WebSocket PTY on TERMINAL_PORT (default 1339)
  -> dashboard (Next.js on PORT, default 1337)
```

Startup lives in `dashboard/scripts/start-peer-services.ts` (chained OpenCode + OpenChamber), with `start-opencode.ts` available for standalone OpenCode use and `terminal-pty-server.ts` for the docked shell. `npm run dev` starts all four via `concurrently`. Peer startup calls `loadEnvWithOnePasswordFallback` before binding ports so provider keys can be resolved from 1Password when local env vars are empty. OpenChamber is only started when a system install is detected.

### Peer Version Updates

On every DevHub start (`npm run dev` / `npm run start`), `ensure-peers-current.ts` best-effort upgrades **OpenCode** before binding ports:

| Peer        | Mechanism                                               | Pin behavior                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenCode    | Runs `opencode upgrade` (no-op when already current)    | Updates the user-installed binary; takes effect on the next clean start |
| OpenChamber | **Not updated by DevHub** — you manage your own install | Whatever version you have installed is what DevHub serves               |

The OpenCode check is **non-fatal** — offline, registry errors, or upgrade failures keep the existing binary and DevHub continues.

| Variable                      | Set to | Effect                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `DEVHUB_SKIP_OPENCODE_UPDATE` | `1`    | Skip `opencode upgrade` on start |

See [Environment Variables](../reference/environment-variables.md) for the full list.

### Port Reuse

If a port is already listening, the startup script assumes the service is already running and keeps the npm/concurrently process alive without starting a duplicate listener.

This lets you attach DevHub to an existing OpenCode session. For OpenChamber, startup also reuses an existing listener on `OPENCHAMBER_PORT`, but shutdown still runs `openchamber stop`. In practice, if DevHub attaches to an already-running OpenChamber on that port, exiting DevHub may stop that existing OpenChamber instance as well.

### OpenChamber → OpenCode Wiring

`cleanOpenChamberEnv()` (in `dashboard/lib/openchamber-command.ts`) sets:

- `OPENCODE_PORT` to the shared DevHub port
- `OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true` so OpenChamber does not spawn a second `opencode serve`
- `OPENCODE_BINARY` when `~/.opencode/bin/opencode` exists (unless `DEVHUB_OPENCODE_BINARY` overrides)

OpenChamber waits up to 30 seconds for OpenCode to listen before starting its own daemon.

## In-App Terminal

The docked terminal is opened from the bottom drawer (or programmatically via `devhub:terminal-open`). Each session spawns a login shell rooted at `DEVHUB_DEVELOPER_DIR` (default `~/Developer`) unless a `cwd` is passed — PR **Review** on `/prs` passes the PR's repo path but still pins `REPO_ROOT`/`NOTES_DIR` to DevHub when `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPO_ROOT` is set.

| Trigger | Behavior |
| ------- | -------- |
| Terminal drawer button | Opens a new shell session at the developer directory |
| PR **Review** (`/prs`) | Runs the configured agent CLI (`opencode run` or `cursor-agent`) with the `pr-explain-review` skill; streams output in the drawer |
| Repo Learning **OpenCode handoff** | Opens a terminal in the target repo with a copied handoff prompt |
| Repos **DX Audit** | Runs the `dx-audit` skill via the configured agent CLI |
| Capability **Build lab** | Runs the `capability-lab` skill in the kitchen-sink workspace |

The PTY server binds **localhost only** and has no authentication — acceptable because DevHub is a local-only tool. Do not expose port `1339` off-host.

Each session's output is **tee'd to disk** (`DEVHUB_TERMINAL_LOG_DIR`, default `<tmpdir>/devhub-terminal-logs/<session-uuid>.log`) so **Copy all output** in the terminal drawer can return the full log via `GET /api/terminal/log?session=<uuid>`. Browser xterm scrollback is RAM-capped; the on-disk log is the source of truth for long PR reviews or builds. Session logs older than three days are pruned on terminal peer startup.

If an interactive shell framework (powerlevel10k, ftazsh, etc.) deadlocks inside the embedded PTY, the server auto-respawns in safe mode after 4 seconds of silence. Override manually with `DEVHUB_TERMINAL_ARGS=-f` or `DEVHUB_TERMINAL_SHELL=/bin/bash` in `dashboard/.env.local`.

For PR review notes to land under `notes/pr-reviews/...`, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPO_ROOT` to the same path as `REPO_ROOT` (not auto-written by postinstall). See [GitHub integration](../integrations/github.md#review-note-constraints).

## Agent CLI selection

One-shot terminal handoffs (PR review, DX audit, capability labs, repo upstart) default to **OpenCode** (`opencode run`), but can be switched to the **Cursor CLI** (`cursor-agent -p … --force --model <model>`, default `cursor-grok-4.5-high`) from **/setup → Agent CLI** or **Skills → Agent CLI**. The Cursor option only appears when `cursor-agent` is installed. An optional OpenCode model override (`opencode run --model provider/model`) can be set the same way; blank keeps the shared `opencode.json` default.

Settings are managed `.env.local` keys — `DEVHUB_AGENT_CLI`, `DEVHUB_AGENT_OPENCODE_MODEL`, `DEVHUB_AGENT_CURSOR_MODEL` — so the 1Password `devhub` item can populate them like other managed config. Server read/detection: `dashboard/lib/agent-cli-env.ts` (`GET`/`PUT /api/agent-cli`); command builders: `dashboard/lib/terminal-launch.ts` (`agent*Command`, async). Both CLIs see the same skills and notes MCP because sync writes them to `~/.cursor/skills` and `~/.cursor/mcp.json` as well as the OpenCode paths — run **Sync skills** / **Sync MCP** before first use.

## OpenCode Session Recap

Agents can summarize **what an OpenCode session did** (commands, MCP calls, file edits, failures) without replaying chat:

| Surface | Entry point |
| ------- | ----------- |
| MCP | `sessions_recap` on the `devhub` server |
| Skill | `devhub-recap` — call the tool and return the JSON unchanged |
| HTTP | `GET /api/opencode/recap` (requires `requireDashboardAuth`; see [API Routes](../reference/api-routes.md)) |

OpenCode must be running on `OPENCODE_PORT`. The recap builder reads the OpenCode HTTP API, redacts secrets, and omits prompts/reasoning. Use `directory` to scope sessions to a workspace; pass `sessionId` when multiple root sessions are busy (`409`).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                       | Default     | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_PORT`                | `1338`      | `opencode serve --port`                                         |
| `OPENCODE_BIND_HOST`           | `127.0.0.1` | `opencode serve --hostname`; LAN access is proxied when enabled |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENCODE_PORT`    | `1338`      | Port in the browser iframe URL                                  |
| `DEVHUB_OPENCODE_BINARY`       | —           | Override path to the `opencode` binary                          |
| `OPENCHAMBER_PORT`             | `1336`      | OpenChamber daemon port                                         |
| `OPENCHAMBER_HOST`             | `127.0.0.1` | OpenChamber local bind host; LAN access is proxied when enabled |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENCHAMBER_PORT` | `1336`      | Port in the Chamber iframe URL                                  |
| `OPENCHAMBER_BIN`              | —           | Override path to the `openchamber` CLI                          |

Legacy `OPENCODE_HOST` is still read as a bind host when it is not a full URL; prefer `OPENCODE_BIND_HOST` for new setups.

See [Environment Variables](../reference/environment-variables.md) for 1Password-related keys.

### Shared OpenCode Config

Source of truth: `opencode/shared/opencode.json` in the repo.

Sync copies only these curated keys into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

- `model`
- `small_model`
- `provider`
- `theme`

Everything else in the local file (MCP block, `$schema`, agents, model catalogue entries OpenCode manages) is left untouched.

Provider API keys in the shared file must use OpenCode placeholders: `{env:VAR_NAME}`. Never commit raw secrets. On sync, DevHub resolves placeholders from `process.env` (including values loaded by the 1Password fallback) and writes concrete values only into the local config.

**Dashboard:** Agents → OpenCode → edit shared config → **Sync OpenCode**.

**API:** `GET` / `PUT` `/api/opencode` reads and updates the shared file; `PUT` rejects JSON that contains raw secrets at secret-like keys.

## 1Password Secret Fallback

Before dev services start, `dashboard/scripts/op-secrets.ts` can populate missing secret env vars from a 1Password item (default title: `devhub`).

| Variable            | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEVHUB_OP_ITEM`    | 1Password item title (default: `devhub`)           |
| `DEVHUB_OP_VAULT`   | Pin vault when multiple items share the same name  |
| `DEVHUB_OP_REFRESH` | Set to `1` to bypass `.env.op-synced` and re-fetch |

After a successful fetch, a marker file `dashboard/.env.op-synced` avoids repeated `op` calls on every restart. Path-only keys (`NOTES_DIR`, bind hosts, etc.) are never fetched from 1Password.

Managed secret names come from the dashboard env allowlist plus any `{env:VAR}` referenced in the shared OpenCode config, so new providers do not require code changes.

## Status and Restarts

The **Status** page probes OpenChamber and OpenCode ports via `/api/status/services`. Restart actions use `/api/status/services/restart` and respect the same port env vars.

**Actions** can launch native apps when installed:

- `/api/actions/launch-chamber` — OpenChamber Desktop pointing at the existing DevHub server (port `1336` / shared OpenCode on `1338`)
- `/api/actions/launch-opencode` — macOS OpenCode Desktop app (when present under `/Applications`)
- `/api/actions/launch-claude` — Claude Desktop when installed; otherwise opens `https://claude.ai/new` in the browser. Available from the top-bar launch menu and command palette.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                 | Things to check                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chamber iframe blank                    | OpenCode listening on `OPENCODE_PORT`; Status page service indicators                                                                        |
| OpenCode won't start                    | `which opencode` or set `DEVHUB_OPENCODE_BINARY`; port `1338` not held by another process                                                    |
| Provider auth errors                    | `/setup` or 1Password item fields; run sync after env vars are set; `DEVHUB_OP_REFRESH=1` once to refresh                                    |
| LAN device can't reach Chamber/OpenCode | Enable LAN mode in `/setup`; it starts the LAN proxy for `1336` and `1338`. On WSL, still forward those ports from Windows (see root README) |
| Two OpenCode instances                  | Should not happen when `OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true`; if you run `opencode serve` manually, let DevHub reuse that port                          |
| Terminal drawer blank or stuck          | Terminal peer on `1339`; check `concurrently` `term` process. Heavy zsh themes may need `DEVHUB_TERMINAL_ARGS=-f`. LAN proxy forwards `1339` when enabled |
| PR review note in wrong repo            | Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPO_ROOT` in `dashboard/.env.local` to match `REPO_ROOT`; restart dev server |
